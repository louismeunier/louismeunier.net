In Winter 2024, I participated in the <a href="https://www.math.mcgill.ca/gsams/drp/index.html" target="_blank">Directed Reading Program </a>(DRP) at McGill University. The focus was on symmetry methods for differential equations, especially with applications to numerical methods. I've compiled the work done in the DRP on this page.
