A set of scripts and website I created as a senior in high school to analyze the emails I received from colleges. The data was generated using the gmail API and ran automatically using Github Actions. The actual site is made with <a class="in-text-link" href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, and while the data isn't updated anymore (as I, thankfully, no longer receive hundreds of college emails a week), the site is still live!
