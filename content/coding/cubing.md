A graph of Rubik's cube states, with the ability to explore the graph and find solutions to the cube. The cube images are generated using [cubing.js](https://js.cubing.net/cubing/). Currently, rather limited in any "practical" use, as the computation/comparison of any more than a few hundred states is very slow, but potentially pre-computing states could improve it.
