      <description>source code A Discord bot for CubingUSA&amp;rsquo;s CubingAtHome (an online international Rubik&amp;rsquo;s Cube competition series) server, written in Javascript and hosted on Heroku. It was used primarily to provide basic utilities (such as scramble generation, event announcement, etc) to the server, and while CubingAtHome is no longer active, the bot is still active today! You can add it here.</description>

      <description>source code live site A set of scripts and website I created as a senior in high school to analyze the emails I received from colleges. The data was generated using the gmail API and ran automatically using Github Actions. The actual site is made with Svelte, and while the data isn&amp;rsquo;t updated anymore (as I, thankfully, no longer receive hundreds of college emails a week), the site is still live!</description>
